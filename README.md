## General Info
Our team was asked to merge two datasets, one of which we had to obtain by scraping a site. Our team used a dataset from kaggle.com and scraped data from yahoofinance.com  to answer the overall arching question of "How does the release of movie and tv shows on the Disney+ platform affect The Walt Disney Company stock price?"


## Features
- fully merged dataset
- various graphs and plots to visualize findings

## Setup
- downloaded and cleaned csv from Kagge.com, read into r, and renamed values
- scraped yahoo finance, read into r, converted to dataframe, and renamed values
- dealt with missing values
- merged data
- analyzed and visualized data

## Project Status
complete

## Room for Improvement
- if future data became available, could see how removing tv shows and movies from Disney+ affect stock price
